									Deeply engaged in advanced VR/AR studies at Champlain College, I am blending theoretical knowledge with practical application to expand the frontiers of immersive technologies. My educational foundation in engineering, complemented by a Master's in International Communication, has been a catalyst for my involvement in the gaming industry, where I have developed AR projects and 3D games with a fervent passion. With over a year of experience in AI-driven image generation, I am familiar with a wide array of AI image tools, which enhances my ability to create compelling visual content. My background in media production, particularly in documentary storytelling, and my fluency in English and Chinese, uniquely equip me to weave technology with cross-cultural narratives. This diverse expertise not only fuels my innovative pursuits but also my ambition to drive forward the realms of media and entertainment with groundbreaking technological advancements.

									</p>I have zero web development experience, actually before doing this application I have no idea how a website works. But I'm definitely willing to learn and tried my best to create this online portfolio in two days, it's not that fancy but it can tell that I could pick up things quickly.
